# Stripe dashboard — product name update

Update the product name in your Stripe dashboard:

- **FROM:** `Competitor Shadow Audit` or `Market Intelligence Report`
- **TO:** `Public Pricing Benchmark`

Price can remain **£29.00**. Description suggestion:

> Automated aggregation of public pricing data. Not professional advice.

**Landing page button text:** "Order Public Pricing Benchmark — £29"

If you cannot edit the existing Stripe Link, create a new product with the safe name and description above, then replace the checkout URL in `index.html` with the new Stripe Link.
