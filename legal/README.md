# Price Synth — Legal safety package

This folder contains materials to help keep Price Synth in **data aggregation** territory (not professional services or advice) for a UK launch with zero budget and no E&O insurance.

**None of this is legal advice.** Have a UK solicitor review your Terms and positioning before launch.

## Contents

| File | Purpose |
|------|--------|
| **CHECKLIST-UK.md** | Pre-launch legal safety checklist (positioning, disclaimers, red flags, sign-off). |
| **TERMS-DRAFT-LIABILITY.md** | Draft ToS clauses: informational use only, no duty of care, limitation of liability (UK). |
| **UI-COPY-HOMEPAGE-DASHBOARD-EXPORT.md** | Safe copy for Homepage, Dashboard, and PDF/CSV exports; labelling rules. |
| **RED-FLAG-AUDIT.md** | Reliance liability, "savings" vs raw data risk, users confronting suppliers. |
| **TECHNICAL-SAFEGUARDS.md** | DB audit trail, API/webhook safety, feature flags to block advisory outputs. |

## Quick start

1. **Review** CHECKLIST-UK.md and RED-FLAG-AUDIT.md.
2. **Insert** TERMS-DRAFT-LIABILITY.md into your full Terms of Service and get solicitor sign-off.
3. **Apply** UI copy from UI-COPY-HOMEPAGE-DASHBOARD-EXPORT.md (homepage, dashboard, exports).
4. **Implement** feature flags and API/export rules in TECHNICAL-SAFEGUARDS.md.
5. **Run** the checklist before go-live and tick sign-off.

## Core principle

**We provide inputs (market range, your price). We do not provide outputs (conclusions, recommendations, or "you are overpaying by X").** That keeps the product in data aggregation, not professional services.
