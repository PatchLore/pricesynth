Use this copy to keep positioning in "data aggregation" territory and avoid reliance/duty-of-care risk.

## Homepage

### Footer / site-wide disclaimer (short)

**Option A (one line):**  
"Price Synth provides aggregated market data for informational use only. Not professional advice. Verify figures independently."

**Option B (two lines):**  
"Market data is aggregated and indicative only. Price Synth does not provide professional advice. Always verify data before making decisions."

### Banner (optional, above fold or below hero)

"Benchmark data only — for negotiation prep. Not a substitute for your own verification or professional advice."

### Value prop (safe framing)

- ✅ "See what others pay for the same SKUs and services."
- ✅ "Benchmark your prices against aggregated market data."
- ✅ "Market intelligence for procurement and negotiation prep."
- ❌ Avoid: "Find overcharges", "Detect overpayments", "Recover money", "Audit your spend".

## Dashboard (comparison / “Your price vs market” screen)

### Near the comparison block (required)

**Short (under the numbers):**  
"Market range and your price are for information only. Not verified; not advice. Verify with your own sources."

**Alternative:**  
"Aggregated benchmark data. Use for context only. Price Synth does not verify prices or provide professional advice."

### How to label the data

| Element | Safe label | Avoid |
|--------|------------|--------|
| Market range | "Market range (aggregated): £X–£Y" | "Recommended price", "Fair price" |
| User’s price | "Your price (as entered): £Z" | "Your rate", "Current price" (if we imply we verified it) |
| Difference | "Difference: £Z vs £X–£Y range" or "Your price vs market range" | "Overcharge", "Savings", "You could save £X" |
| Any calculated £ | Prefer: "Range midpoint: £M" (factual). Avoid: "Potential savings: £S" | "You're overpaying by £X", "Savings opportunity: £X" |

### Tooltip or help (optional)

"Data is from aggregated sources. We don’t verify your contracts or recommend actions. Use for negotiation prep only."

## Export (PDF / CSV)

### PDF — first page or header on every page

"Price Synth — Informational benchmark data only. Not professional advice. Verify independently. © [Year] Price Synth."

**Short block (e.g. under title):**  
"This export contains aggregated market data for informational use only. It does not constitute advice, verification, or a recommendation. Do not rely on it as the sole basis for negotiations or disputes. Verify all figures with your own sources."

### CSV — first row or separate readme

**If you add a disclaimer row:**

## Consistency rules

1. **Never** use "verified", "certified", "recommended", "you should", or "we advise" in relation to prices or actions.
2. **Always** pair any comparison (your price vs range) with a short disclaimer on the same screen/section.
3. **Prefer** "market range" and "your price (as entered)" over "savings" or "overcharge" amounts we calculate.
4. **Exports** must carry the same "informational only; not advice" message on every page or in header/footer.
