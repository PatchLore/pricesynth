## 1. Nature of service and informational use only

Price Synth provides **market intelligence and benchmark data** derived from aggregated, publicly available and/or purchased data sources. The service is for **informational and benchmarking purposes only**. It does not constitute:

- professional advice (including legal, financial, or procurement advice);
- an audit, assurance, or compliance product;
- a recommendation or suggestion as to any particular course of action; or
- a verification or certification of any price, contract, or supplier.

You are solely responsible for your own verification of data, negotiation decisions, and any use of the service. You must not rely on Price Synth as the sole basis for confronting suppliers, disputing invoices, or making contractual decisions.

---

## 2. No duty of care; no advisory relationship

Price Synth operates as a **data aggregation and presentation tool**. No advisory or professional relationship is created between you and Price Synth. We do not owe you a duty of care in respect of any decision you make using or referring to the service. You use the service at your own risk.

---

## 3. Accuracy and completeness

All data is **indicative and aggregated**. We do not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or timeliness of any data or output. Market ranges and comparisons are derived from multiple sources and may not reflect your specific situation, contract terms, or jurisdiction. You should verify any figures independently before relying on them.

---

## 4. Limitation of liability (UK)

To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law in England and Wales:

- Price Synth (and its directors, employees, and contractors) shall not be liable for any indirect, consequential, special, or punitive loss or damage, including but not limited to loss of profits, revenue, contracts, or data.
- Our total liability to you in respect of any claim or series of connected claims arising from or in connection with the service shall not exceed the fees actually paid by you to us in the twelve (12) months preceding the claim (or £100 if greater), except where liability cannot be limited by law (e.g. death or personal injury caused by our negligence, or fraud).
- We do not have professional indemnity or errors & omissions insurance in place at the date of these terms. You acknowledge that you use the service in awareness of this.

Nothing in these terms excludes or limits our liability for death or personal injury caused by our negligence, fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation, or any other liability that cannot be excluded or limited under applicable law.

---

## 5. Your use and indemnity

You agree to use the service only for lawful purposes and in line with these terms. You will not use the service to create an impression that Price Synth has verified, certified, or endorsed any price or supplier, or that our data constitutes professional advice. You indemnify us against any claim, loss, or cost arising from your misuse of the service or your reliance on it as professional advice.

---

## 6. Data sources and audit trail

We aggregate data from multiple sources (public and/or licensed). We do not represent that any single source or our aggregation is complete or error-free. Where we provide source or methodology information, it is for transparency only and does not amount to a warranty of accuracy.
